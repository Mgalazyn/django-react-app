# gym_app   

It's app created in Django-React to develop my skills as a full-stack developer. Basic concept of the app is to create API in DRF to handle Login/Register User, displaying videos of exercises, displaying description about exercises etc. Then by React to display data, have possiblity to contact with me by contact form and build your own workout from exercises displaying from API.
